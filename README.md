## One Stop Code Shop
A learning tool built for bootcampers, by bootcampers. One Stop Code Shope is a new platform for web development students to quickly find educational resources and engage in a like-minded community of budding developers. Our goal for this project is to create a single, go-to platform for beginners to successfully navigate their own coding journey.

You can visit the deployed project [here](https://onestopcodeshop.herokuapp.com/) 

## Motivation
The web is full of countless resources for developers to enhance their skills. The problem is, there is no easy way for students to quickly find what they are looking for; often we are bouncing around Google search results with thousands of tabs open. We wanted to reduce this time wasted by quickly gathering results from several common coding resources.

Additionally, as bootcampers, we know firsthand the kind of impact a learning community can have. There is true strength in numbers and we wanted to incorporate social capabilities alongside these learning tools.
